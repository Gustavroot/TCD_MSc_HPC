HPL simulations:

 ** either through the use of sbatch.sh or general.sh (directly),
    this implementation runs a full set of combinations of values
    for testing HPL, for a given number of cores

Steps:

 -- locate the hpl-2.1.tar.gz file at the same level of this
	README file
 -- if submitting with SLURM: in the file sbatch.sh, modify the
	lines starting with '#SBATCH -n' and '#SBATCH -t' to
	configure for the specific number of cores and JOB's time,
        and also modify the last line to pass the number of cores
	to the general.sh bash script
 -- in the Python script 'hpl_dat_config.py', at line 19 the value
	28000 corresponds to 80% of the total RAM per node; modify
	accordingly. Also in that file, modify lines 25, 27 and 29
	to set the combinations for PxQ, and lines 21 and 23 to
	set the NBs values
 -- if running manually (i.e. not using the 'sbatch.sh' script),
	then simply run './general.sh NR_CORES' on the terminal,
	after specifying values in hpl_dat_config.py
